# COMP0004SimpleOrderSystem
Developed a Java web application that has access to and can update patient data, displayed in a data frame.
I used JSP's and servlets to display the data, and a search algorithm to efficiently search through large datasets.

MAIDEN, MARITAL, RACE, ETHNICITY, GENDER, BIRTHPLACE, ADDRESS, CITY, STATE, ZIP
