# COMP0004SimpleOrderSystem
Developed a Java web application that has access to and can update patient data, displayed in a data frame.
I used JSP's and servlets to display the data, and a search algorithm to efficiently search through large datasets.
ID, BIRTHDATE, DEATHDATE, SSN, DRIVERS, PASSPORT, PREFIX, FIRST, LAST, SUFFIX,
MAIDEN, MARITAL, RACE, ETHNICITY, GENDER, BIRTHPLACE, ADDRESS, CITY, STATE, ZIP

The purpose of this was to learn the underlying Model-View-Controller pattern, so a Java Servlet only contains code to recieve http requests, call methods to manipulate data and forward data to a JSP.
Here, the html and CSS would be generated using Java Server Pages.
